# Python Task Manager & Daily Scheduler
A console-based Task Manager and Daily Scheduler built in Python 3.
This project implements:
A Task class with completion tracking
A TaskManager class to add, list, mark, and clear tasks
A menu-driven command-line interface with input validation
A ScheduledTask subclass with duration and time constraints
A greedy scheduling algorithm that builds a daily schedule within an 8-hour window
The scheduler respects task duration, earliest start, and latest finish constraints, and returns a valid schedule without modifying the original tasks.
The program is fully written in a single Python file and uses only standard libraries.
